#CIFAR-10 IMAGE CLASSIFICATION

This project aims to learn how to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras with a TensorFlow backend, and learn to train CNNs to solve Image Classification problems. In this project, we will create and train a CNN model on a subset of the popular CIFAR-10 dataset.
